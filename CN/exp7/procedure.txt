
Step 1: Prepare Your Environment
Launch Wireshark.

Step 2: Start Packet Capture and Generate Traffic
Select Interface: In Wireshark, select your active interface (Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
Apply Capture Filter (Optional): To minimize noise, use this filter before starting capture:
tcp port 80 or tcp port 443
(HTTP uses port 80; HTTPS/encrypted traffic uses port 443).
Start Capture.
Generate HTTP Traffic: Open a browser (like Chrome or Edge) and visit a non-secure (non-HTTPS) website. A good choice is a simple website that definitely uses HTTP (like the older versions of a news site or a local test server). If you can't find a clean HTTP site, visiting any site like example.com will generate TCP/IP traffic, but the HTTP part will be encrypted (HTTPS/TLS).
Tip: Use the browser's developer tools (F12) to ensure the request is actually HTTP, or use a command-line tool like curl to guarantee an unencrypted request.
Step 3: Analyze the TCP and IP Headers
Apply Display Filter: In the Wireshark Display Filter box, type:
tcp
Look for a sequence of three packets that make up the TCP 3-way Handshake:
Stop Capture: Quickly switch back to Wireshark and click the Stop button (r

Examine the Network Layer (IP):
Click on the first TCP packet ([SYN]).
In the middle "Details" pane, expand the Internet Protocol Version 4 (or 6) layer.
Analyze the key fields:
Source Address: Your machine's IP address (Client).
Destination Address: The web server's IP address (Network Layer).

Examine the Transport Layer (TCP):
Expand the Transmission Control Protocol layer.
Analyze the key fields:
Source Port: Random high number (Client).
Destination Port: 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS) (Server).
Sequence Number and Acknowledgement Number: These are crucial for ordered and reliable delivery.
Flags ([SYN], [ACK]): Shows the state of the connection.rotocol: Shows TCP (Value 6). This identifies the Transport Layer protocol being carried.ed square icon).







Step 4: Analyze the Application Layer (HTTP)
Apply Display Filter: In the Wireshark Display Filter box, type:
http
Examine the Request: Find the packet labeled HTTP with an Info field like GET / or GET /index.html.
Expand the Hypertext Transfer Protocol layer.
Request Line: Shows the method (GET), the path (/), and the version (HTTP/1.1).
Header Fields: Contains information like Host, User-Agent, and Accept-Language.
Examine the Response: Find the packet labeled HTTP with an Info field like HTTP/1.1 200 OK.
Expand the Hypertext Transfer Protocol layer.
Status Line: Shows the status code (200 OK) which means the request succeeded.

Header Fields: Contains server information, date, and content type.
